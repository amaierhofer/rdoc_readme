== First

First things first.  We add some headings ..

== Second

Then come others. We try to reference them using links 

== Third

We are done. Seems like local anchors are not accepted while absolute anchors are fine. 

== Forth

We are done. This behavior is different from what {github-markup}[https://github.com/github/markup] generates on the filesystem.
